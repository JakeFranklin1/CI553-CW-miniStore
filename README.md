I've provided a ministore-windows.jar and a ministore-macos.jar so that the program can be ran easily. 

To run the program, either double click to open the .jar or alternatively navigate to the folder and run the terminal command: **java -jar ministore-windows.jar** (recommended)

The logins for the staff account are:

USER1 + PASSWORD1
USER2 + PASSWORD2

This project uses Maven, please keep that in mind if trying to run in an IDE. There is a walkthrough in my report for this.
